## Ops Readings

### Reading #2

This reading is imporatnt to understand because knowing the components and operation of the computer is fundamental to move into more advanced computer knowledge and industries such as Cybersecurity. 

1.	Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need? It depends on the use of the computer. Speed is better for gaming and programs that use large amounts of information. Cores are used running multiple programs at the same time or using more applications at the same time.

2.	What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
The motherboard needs to fit the computer and that it is compatible with the processor. Other things to look for are PCI/e slots, Wi-Fi, Ram slots, and Bluetooth.

3.	What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
SSDs are so popular due to their advantages, which are they contain no moving parts, faster access to stored information, and they use less power. HDDs store data using a mix of magnetic and mechanical parts, making them bulkier and susceptible to damage like being dropped. Even though there are more advantages to SSDs, they are more expensive.

4.	Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
	I would pull up resources such as https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer, so I can have an illustration to explain the parts of the computer. I find that trying to explain technology without a reference is difficult to understand.

The video is a helpful reference to re-visit because of the demontration of building a PC.
