SSH Protocol

1. What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
SSH is a tool for securing remote access to servers and devices and is commonly used for tasks like remote administration, file transfers (using tools like SCP and SFTP), and secure tunneling.

2. What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
Typical uses are remote shell access, file transfers, Remote desktop access, and tunneling.  

3.	How does the SSH protocol work?
SSH encrypts data so that someone trying to intercept the message cannot read what's being sent. They only know that data is being transmitted.

4.	How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
The SSH protocol encrypts all communication in transit between the client and server.

5.	What is SFTP?
It is a network protocol mostly used for transferring files over the web. It builds on the classic File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and includes Secure Shell (SSH) security components.
