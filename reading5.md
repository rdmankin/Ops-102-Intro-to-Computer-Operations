# Ray's Ops Reading Notes

## Ops Readings

### Reading 5

1.	Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
Shell: A shell is a cli program that provides a way for users to interact with an operating system by typing text-based commands.
Terminal: It is a software application that allows a user to interact with a shell.
CLI: A cli is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software by entering commands and receiving text-based responses.
Command Prompt: It is a specific type of shell interface used in operating systems. It provides a text-based environment for running commands and scripts.
These are still used because there are advantages such as efficiency, automation and learning skill development.
